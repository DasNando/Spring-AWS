# Spring-AWS
The beginning of a practice project for my two favorite technologies!

I am making a commitment to add something new to this project every single day, except for weekends when I'm back in SA and days where I'm otherwise busy (like SXSW.)

What am I interested in learning from this?
- Get better at Spring Framework
- Microservices Architecture
- More experience with databases, especially NOSQL with Cassandra
- Put my AWS skills into practice by deploying this app using AWS and integrating as many AWS services as possible, within reason.
- CI/CD tech, like Jenkins and Travis
- Unit Testing practice
- To keep a record/journal of the things I learn!!
- JavaScript in general, NodeJS in particular


Wish me luck, friends. I want to be a better developer and I can't just let my workplace experience be the only driver in this endeavor. I don't know what this webapp will be quite yet, but we'll figure something out. Maybe a copy of LegalSchmold..

Day 1:
I'm starting with the Spring guide to getting started with Gradle. The tutorial recommended using SDKMAN and I can immediately see how this will be useful. I'm also developing strictly in vim in order to get over the crutch that is an IDE. Hopefully this improves my fundamentals well enough. Also, start doing 30m a day of Bash school and SQL school.
