# Spring-AWS
The beginning of a practice project for my two favorite technologies!

I am making a commitment to add something new to this project every single day, except for weekends when I'm back in SA and days where I'm otherwise busy (like SXSW.)

What am I interested in learning from this?
	- Get better at Spring Framework
	- Microservices Architecture
	- More experience with databases, especially NOSQL with Cassandra
	- Put my AWS skills into practice by deploying this app using AWS and integrating as many AWS services as possible, within reason.
	- CI/CD tech, like Jenkins and Travis
	- Unit Testing practice
	- To keep a record/journal of the things I learn!!
	- JavaScript in general, NodeJS in particular


Wish me luck, friends. I want to be a better developer and I can't just let my workplace experience be the only driver in this endeavor. I don't know what this webapp will be quite yet, but we'll figure something out.
